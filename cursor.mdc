## Objective
Create a simple hello-world project, executable in Docker, ready for build and deploy via MCP for Quave Cloud.

## General Rules
- Keep the project as simple as possible
- Do not add authentication, database, or unnecessary dependencies
- Use only a basic static website
- Code should be easy to understand and modify

## Expected Structure
- A single static website
- A Dockerfile at the project root
- An HTML file as the main entry point

## Application
- Must serve a static HTML page at route `/`
- The HTML should display: "Docker for FinTech httpd zCloud example"
- The application should use the static website server from the base image

## Dockerfile
- Must use `lipanski/docker-static-website:latest` as the base image
- Must copy all files to the container (COPY . .)
- The base image handles the web server and port configuration automatically

## HTML Content
- Must include proper HTML structure with head and body tags
- Title should be: "Docker httpd by zCloud"
- Body content should be: "Docker for FinTech httpd zCloud example"
- Must include proper meta tags for charset, viewport, and compatibility

## Execution
- The container should start with a single command
- No external configuration should be required
- The project should work with:
  - docker build
  - docker run

## Limitations
- Do not use complex frameworks
- Do not add extra logic
- Do not create multiple containers
- Do not include additional documentation
